## Abstract

In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless networks, efficient video transmission is crucial for applications such as surveillance, disaster response, and remote sensing, yet remains challenging due to limited computational resources and energy constraints. In this paper, we present a video transmission scheme for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks that enhances both communication and energy efficiency in challenging environments. To address the computational constraints of UAVs while improving video reconstruction quality, we propose a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) method with a lightweight encoder. This encoder integrates traditional distributed video coding with deep learning models to achieve computational and energy efficiency. Additionally, we employ deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize relay node selection based on residual energy, improving the endurance of the UAV swarm. Simulation results show that our lightweight feature extraction model requires only 1.81\% of the complexity of the deep contextual video compression scheme (DCVC) and 16.56\% of low-complexity deep video compression (L-DVC), while maintaining comparable or superior video reconstruction performance across various channel conditions. Furthermore, the proposed approach significantly improves energy efficiency, extending both hover time and exploration range compared to conventional energy-saving schemes.
